# LShapedSolvers.jl

`LShapedSolvers` is a collection of structured optimization algorithms for two-stage (L-shaped) stochastic recourse problems. All algorithm variants are based on the L-shaped method by Van Slyke and Wets. `LShapedSolvers` interfaces with [StochasticPrograms.jl][StochProg], and a given recourse model `sp` is solved effectively through

```julia
julia> using LShapedSolvers

julia> solve(sp,solver=LShapedSolver(:ls,ClpSolver()))
L-Shaped Gap  Time: 0:00:01 (4 iterations)
  Objective:       -855.8333333333358
  Gap:             2.1229209144670507e-15
  Number of cuts:  5
:Optimal

```

Note, that an LP capable `AbstractMathProgSolver` is required to solve emerging subproblems. The following variants of the L-shaped algorithm are implemented:

1. L-shaped with multiple cuts (default): `LShapedSolver(:ls)`
2. L-shaped with regularized decomposition: `LShapedSolver(:rd)`
3. L-shaped with trust region: `LShapedSolver(:tr)`
4. L-shaped with level sets: `LShapedSolver(:lv)`

Note, that `LShapedSolver(:rd)` and `LShapedSolver(:lv)` both require a QP capable `AbstractMathProgSolver` for the master problems. If not available, setting the `linearize` keyword to `true` is an alternative.

In addition, there is a distributed variant of each algorithm:

1. Distributed L-shaped with multiple cuts: `LShapedSolver(:dls)`
2. Distributed L-shaped with regularized decomposition: `LShapedSolver(:drd)`
3. Distributed L-shaped with trust region: `LShapedSolver(:dtr)`
4. Distributed L-shaped with level sets: `LShapedSolver(:dlv)`

which requires adding processes with `addprocs` prior to execution.

Each algorithm has a set of parameters that can be tuned prior to execution. For a list of these parameters and their default values, use `?` in combination with the solver object. For example, `?LShaped` gives the parameter list of the default L-shaped algorithm. For a list of all solvers and their handle names, use `?LShapedSolver`.

`LShapedSolvers.jl` includes a set of crash methods that can be used to generate the initial decision by supplying functor objects to `LShapedSolver`. Use `?Crash` for a list of available crashes and their usage.
