I graduated from KTH’s Engineering Physics programme in 2016 and received a MSc in _Applied and Computational Mathematics_. Since August of 2016 I am pursuing a doctoral degree at the [Department of Automatic Control](https://www.kth.se/en/ees/omskolan/organisation/avdelningar/ac) at KTH, under the supervision of Prof. [Mikael Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~mikaelj/) and co-supervision of Prof. [Lennart Söder](https://www.kth.se/profile/lsod/).

My research interests lie within optimization, parallel computations and control theory. I am also interested in software development, and enjoy implementing mathematical ideas into useful applications. My current research project involves the development of scalable optimization algorithms, that could allow for accurate real-time optimization of the Swedish hydropower networks.
