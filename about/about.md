I graduated from KTH’s Engineering Physics programme in 2016 and received a MSc in _Applied and Computational Mathematics_. Since August of 2016 I am pursuing a doctoral degree at the [Department of Automatic Control](https://www.kth.se/en/ees/omskolan/organisation/avdelningar/ac) at KTH, under the supervision of Prof. [Mikael Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~mikaelj/) and co-supervision of Prof. [Lennart Söder](https://www.kth.se/profile/lsod/) and Prof. [Henrik Sandberg](https://people.kth.se/~hsan/).

My research interests lie within optimization, parallel computations and control theory. I am also interested in software development, and appreciate the prospect of implementing mathematical ideas into useful applications. My current research project involves the development of scalable optimization algorithms, that could allow for accurate real-time optimization of the Swedish hydropower networks.
