I graduated from KTHâ€™s Engineering Physics programme in 2016 and received a MSc in _Applied and Computational Mathematics**, and a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at KTH in 2021. Since 2022, I am employed as a researcher at the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI).

My research interests lie within optimization, parallel computations and control theory. I am also interested in software development, and enjoy implementing mathematical ideas into useful applications.
