My software package [StochasticPrograms.jl](/software/lshaped) is now an official Julia package. It can be installed through
```julia
pkg> add StochasticPrograms
```
in Julia 1.0 (`] add StochasticPrograms` in a Julia prompt). Moreover, a thorough documentation of the package is now available [here](https://martinbiel.github.io/StochasticPrograms.jl/dev/).
