---

Our paper **POLO.Jl: Policy-based optimization algorithms in Julia** has been accepted to the [Advances in Engineering Software](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/advances-in-engineering-software) journal and is available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965997818311049).

This is a joint work with my colleague Arda Aytekin and supervisor Mikael Johansson. The paper presents an extension of our software framework [POLO](https://github.com/pologrp/polo) to the Julia programming lanugage. We showcase how efficient algorithms can be quickly prototyped in the framework. All code is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/pologrp).
