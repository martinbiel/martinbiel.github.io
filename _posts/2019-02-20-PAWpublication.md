I presented the paper **Distributed L-shaped Algorithms in Julia** at the [Parallel Applications Workshop](https://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/), held in conjuction with [The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/), in Dallas on November 16, 2018. The presentation I held can be viewed [here](/publications/paw2018/presentation.pdf) and the paper itself is now available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8639173/).
