Our paper **Distributed L-shaped Algorithms in Julia** has been accepted to the [Parallel Applications Workshop](https://sourceryinstitute.github.io/PAW/), to be held in conjuction with [The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/), in Dallas on November 16, 2018.

The paper involves implementation details and numerical experiments of my Julia software package [LShapedSolvers.jl](/software/lshaped), with a focus on distributed computations. The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/martinbiel/LShapedSolvers.jl). The workshop follows a [reproducibility initiative](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/submit/sc-reproducibility-initiative/) which we have followed. Instructions on how to reproduce the results presented in this paper are given [here](https://github.com/martinbiel/paw-atm-reproducibility).
