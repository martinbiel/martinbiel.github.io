I presented the paper **Efficient Trajectory Reshaping in a Dynamic Environment** at the [15th International Workshop on Advanced Motion Control](http://ewh.ieee.org/conf/amc/2018/index.html). The presentation I held can be viewed [here](/publications/amc2018/presentation.pdf) and the paper itself is available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8371062/). This publication is the result of continued efforts on my master thesis work at ABB Robotics, in collaboration with my previous supervisor [Mikael Norrl√∂f](http://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/mino/index.html).
