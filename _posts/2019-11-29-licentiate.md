title: Licentiate thesis
---

I presented and defended my licentiate thesis **Distributed Stochastic Programming with Applications to Large-Scale Hydropower Operations**. The thesis is available in [DiVA](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1368577&dswid=-1265).

I would like to thank [Stein W. Wallace](https://www.nhh.no/en/employees/faculty/stein-w.-wallace/) for agreeing to act as special reviewer on my seminar and for his insightful feedback.
