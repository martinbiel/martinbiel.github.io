title: PUMPS Summer School 2017
---

I attended the "Programming and Tuning Massively Parallel Systems" (PUMPS) summer course of 2017. The course was offered at UPC, Barcelona, and featured many interesting topics related to GPU programming. I was awarded with "Best achievement" for my work with the hands-on exercises during the course.
