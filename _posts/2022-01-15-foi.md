title: Researcher at FOI
---

Since graduating from KTH I am employed as a researcher at the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI).

My open-source software package [StochasticPrograms.jl](https://github.com/martinbiel/StochasticPrograms.jl) will only be worked on during my free time, but my hope is that the framework can thrive and evolve without my 100% involvement.
