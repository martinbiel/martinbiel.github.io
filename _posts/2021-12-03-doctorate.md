title: Doctoral thesis
---

I presented and defended my doctoral thesis **Distributed Stochastic Programming with Applications to Large-Scale Hydropower Operations**. The thesis is available in [DiVA](http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1609091&dswid=4602).

I would like to thank [David Woodruff](https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/profile/david-woodruff) for agreeing to act as opponent during my defense and for the insightful discussions that followed. I would also like to direct thanks to all members of the grading committee:
