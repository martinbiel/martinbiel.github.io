I held a talk titled **Distributed Hydropower Models in StochasticPrograms.jl** at the [The XV International Conference on Stochastic Programming ](https://www.ntnu.edu/icsp). The talk is available [here](/publications/ICSP_2019/presentation.pdf). I also attended an insightful PhD summer course in stochastic programming.
