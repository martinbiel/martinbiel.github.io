I held a talk titled **Stochastic Programming for Hydropower Operations** at the [The Second Annual JuMP-dev Workshop](https://www.juliaopt.org/meetings/bordeaux2018/). The talk is available as a live recording on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy81-fRFnfY) and can also be read [here](/publications/jumpdev_2018/presentation.pdf). The talk gives an introduction to the packages available on my [Software](/software/) pages, with a focus on [StochasticPrograms.jl](/software/stochasticprograms).
